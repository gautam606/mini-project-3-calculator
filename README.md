I've created a fully functional calculator with a clean, modern design! Here's what it includes:
Features:

Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo (%)
Clear button (C) to reset everything
Backspace button (⌫) to delete the last digit
Decimal point support
Displays previous operation above current input
Prevents division by zero
Keyboard support for easy typing
